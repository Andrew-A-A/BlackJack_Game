## Blackjack Game

**Project Overview**

This project implements a simple Blackjack game using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java. The game utilizes pre-built UI components for a user-friendly interface.

**Features**

* **Basic Blackjack Rules:** Adheres to standard Blackjack rules, including card values, hand totals, and dealer behavior.
* **Dealer Logic:** Implements basic dealer rules, including hitting until reaching a total of 17 or higher.
* **Win/Loss Tracking:** Keeps track of player wins, losses, and ties.

**OOP Implementation**

* **Encapsulation:** Data members are private and accessed through public methods, ensuring data integrity.
* **Inheritance:** The Hand class can potentially be extended to create different types of players (e.g., human, computer).
* **Polymorphism:** Different types of hands could potentially be treated as the same in certain contexts.

**UI Components**

* **Pre-built UI items:** The project leverages existing UI components (e.g., buttons, labels, images) to create a visually appealing interface.
* **Event Handling:** Handles user interactions (e.g., button clicks) to update the game state and display the results.
